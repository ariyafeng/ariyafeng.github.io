							<h1>StudyMatch</h1>
<p>Study Match is a tool used across all products in the education vertical at Red Ventures. Its goal is to allow non-traditional students to find a school or degree program that is best for them. My final project as a digital design intern at Red Ventures was to prototype and conduct user research on a tool for Study Match that allows users to compare features across different schools.</p>

<p> I helped build out two <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Jez9Cod6gvrM2tRJ2H0hb0/StudyMatch-Testing?page-id=2747%3A103213&node-id=2747%3A103703&viewport=303%2C48%2C0.05&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=2747%3A103703&show-proto-sidebar=1" target="_blank"> prototype </a> variations (A and B) of the design for the comparison tool using Figma.  </p>

                    <h1 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 500; color:black">User Interviews </h1>
                    <p>10 unmoderated interviews were conducted on usertesting.com. Users interacted with the two prototypes and were given a list of prompts to answer. A task was given to assess how well information was conveyed across the two prototpyes.</p>

                        <p>Most users (9 out of 10) preferred version A of the prototype because of the vertical scrolling being more intuitive. However, people still liked the idea of being able to compare more than two schools (version B). Based on the feedback the tests revealed, I was able to create a list of recommendations to improve upon further iterations of the product:</p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt > • Add a price tab before the compare page</dt>
                            <dt > • Keep version A with the option to add more schools</dt>
                            <dt> • Vertical scrolling for school information</dt>
                            <dt> • Horizontal scrolling between different schools/programs </dt>

                        </dl>
                </div>
