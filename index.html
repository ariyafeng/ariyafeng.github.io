                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p id="caption3">Hi, I'm Ariya (pronounced uh-ree-yuh). I grew up in Maryland and currently attend Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. I am studying Policy Analysis and Management and minoring in Design and Environmental Analysis.<br><br> My interests in policy actually came from writing my children's book and seeing the power that words had on people. As for design, I've always had a love for art and drawing and see design as a way of connecting people and art through real-life applications. And I care about the environment. A lot. So what could be a better combination than policy and environmental analysis? <br><br><br> Feel free to contact me at &nbsp <a id="linkedin" href="">ariyafeng@gmail.com </a><br>or connect with me on &nbsp<a id="linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariyafeng/">LinkedIn.</a>
